# Creating a new TestProject OpenSDK Project

This is the example application of a blog post which describes how you can create a
new project which uses the TestProject OpenSDK by using either Maven or Gradle.

If you want to use Maven, you can run the tests by using the command:

    mvn clean test

If you want to use Gradle, you can run the tests by using the command:

    gradle clean test

**Note: The tests will fail because the TestProject developer key isn't provided. This is
the expected behavior and the next blog post of my TestProject OpenSDK 
tutorial describes how you can fix this problem.**
